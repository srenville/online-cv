    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My career in computer science began in 2013 after my completion of a degree in the subject area from the
      University of Guyana. I began working at the  Bureau of Statistics in the Information Systems department at a supervisory position
      and have been working there since.  Over the years, I facilitated many staff training activities; I was the leader of
      the GuyD_Info support group which was used to bring awareness to government agencies on the use of this tool, provided
      by UNICEF, to monitor Guyana's Mellenneum Development Goals. I was the IT-Lead on the Ministry of Health Stepwise Survey and
      the representative, in Mahdia, for the Ministry of Education's Mathematics and Science Survey.
